- **No Behavior Changes**: Pure documentation and template additions
- **Enforces Professional Workflow**: Ensures all contributors (including AI assistants) follow structured PR process with quality gates

### Changed - Step 96: Inline unit detail accordion
- **Inline Accordion**: Converted unit detail from bottom overlay to inline accordion
- **UX Improvement**: Detail panel now expands directly under the clicked unit row
- **One at a Time**: Only one unit detail open at a time; clicking another closes the first
- **Toggle Behavior**: Clicking the same unit again collapses the panel
- **No Overlay**: Removed bottom overlay (#unitDetailBox) in favor of inline expansion
- **Width Matches Table**: Detail panel spans full table width, no fixed overlay dimensions
- **CSS Animation**: Smooth slideDown animation when panel opens
- **Accessibility Maintained**: Full ARIA attributes, keyboard support (Enter/Space/Escape)
- **Focus Management**: Focus moves into panel on open, returns to button on close
- **Updated Tests**: All Playwright tests updated for inline accordion behavior:
  - Test inline row insertion and removal
  - Test switching between units (first closes, second opens)
  - Test Escape key closes panel and restores focus
  - Test toggle behavior (open/close same unit)
  - Test amenity adjustment in inline panel
- **CSS Updates**: Replaced .unit-detail-box styles with .unit-detail-row and .inline-unit-detail-content
- **No Behavior Change**: Pricing math, guardrails, floorplan UI unchanged

### Added - Step 95: Unit detail term pricing table (unit baseline)
- **Term Pricing Table**: Added full term pricing breakdown (2-14 months) in unit detail panel
- **Unit Baseline Calculation**: Unit baseline = floorplan baseline + amenity adjustment
- **Term Premiums Applied**: Each term shows price with short-term premium, over-cap, and seasonality adjustments
- **Pricing Functions**: Added `computeUnitBaseline()`, `computeUnitTermPrices()`, `renderUnitTermTable()` to `pricing-unit.js`
- **Helper Functions**: Exposed `shortTermAdj()` and `getSeasonalityMultiplier()` in `pricing-helpers.js`
- **Visual Presentation**: Term table matches floorplan table style with Term, Price, Notes columns
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels on term pricing section
- **Playwright Tests**: Extended `tests/unit-details.spec.ts` with tests for:
  - Term table rendering (verifies all 13 terms present)
  - 2-month and 14-month term rows visible
  - Amenity adjustment reflected in baseline
- **Updated Tests**: Updated smoke tests to reference Step 95
- **No Behavior Change**: Existing floorplan pricing, renewals, and UI outside unit detail unchanged

### Fixed - Step 94: Unit-level Details expand/collapse with accessibility + Playwright test
- **Expand Button**: Fixed unit-level expand button functionality (previously non-functional)
- **Detail Overlay**: Implemented proper openUnitDetail/closeUnitDetail functions
- **Accessibility**: Added full ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `type="button"`)
- **Keyboard Support**: Enter/Space keys activate expand buttons
- **Event Delegation**: Safe re-render with delegated click handlers on `#unitPricingSection`
- **Playwright Tests**: Added `tests/unit-details.spec.ts` to verify DOM structure and accessibility
- **CI Integration**: Unit details tests now run automatically on PRs
- **Documentation**: Added troubleshooting section to README for unit details
- **No Behavior Change**: No changes to pricing logic or renewals

### Changed - Step 92: Rename baseline step file for clarity
- **File Rename**: Renamed `Step 89E — architecture boundaries + docs (no behavior change).html` to `Step 89E — Stable Baseline (manual testing).html`
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated README.md, WORKFLOW.md, and other docs to reference new filename
- **No Behavior Change**: Pure file rename for clarity; all functionality preserved
- **Purpose**: Makes the role of Step 89E as the stable baseline for manual testing more obvious

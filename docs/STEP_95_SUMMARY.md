## Step 89E Status

**Step 89E is now superseded by Step 95.**

### Why Step 95 Replaces Step 89E:

1. **Step 89E** (October 22, 2025)
   - Architecture boundaries + documentation
   - No unit detail expand functionality
   - No term pricing in unit details
   - Missing Steps 90, 91, 94 improvements

2. **Step 95** (October 23, 2025)  ✅ CURRENT
   - All Step 89E features included
   - Plus: Unit detail expand/collapse (Step 94)
   - Plus: Full term pricing table (Step 95)
   - Plus: CI infrastructure (Steps 90-91)
   - Plus: Comprehensive testing
   - Plus: All documentation updated

**Recommendation:** Use Step 95 for all manual testing going forward. Step 89E served its purpose as an architectural checkpoint but is now historical.

## Overview

Step 97 adds comprehensive branching and PR policy documentation to enforce a professional GitHub workflow for all contributors (including AI assistants). This establishes a structured **feature branch → PR → CI → merge → tag** process with automated quality gates.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Pull Request Template
**File**: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (NEW)

Created comprehensive PR template with:
- **Pre-PR Checklist**: 9 items covering branch naming, title format, Step file, CHANGELOG, lint/test/smoke
- **Type of Change**: Standard conventional commit types with checkboxes
- **Testing Section**: Automated tests + manual smoke check
- **macOS Chromium Note**: Documents known compatibility issue with workaround
- **Post-Merge Checklist**: Tagging, releases, documentation updates
- **Structured Sections**: What changed, testing done, screenshots, notes for reviewers

**Purpose**: Ensures every PR includes all necessary information and passes quality gates before merge.

**Purpose**: Establishes a clear testing reference point for all contributors.

#### Added "Contributing Workflow" Section
- **Quick Start**: 6-step workflow from branch creation to tagging
- **Links**: Direct links to WORKFLOW.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, GIT_WORKFLOW.md
- **Overview**: High-level explanation of feature branch → PR → CI → merge → tag process

**Purpose**: Provides immediate orientation for new contributors.

7. **macOS Chromium Note**: Known issue and WebKit workaround
8. **Merge Requirements**: Green CI, manual smoke check, code review
9. **Tag Release**: Semantic versioning with annotated tags
10. **Optional GitHub Release**: Milestone releases with assets

### 4. CONTRIBUTING.md Updates

#### Added "Contributor Checklists" Section

**Three Comprehensive Checklists**:

1. **Pre-PR Checklist** (15 items):
   - Code Quality: Branch, Step file, patterns, comments
   - Testing: Lint, boundaries, smoke, manual checks
   - Documentation: CHANGELOG, Step file link, architecture docs
   - Commit Quality: Conventional format, clarity, no conflicts

2. **PR Review Expectations**:
   - **What Makes a Good PR**: One small step, quality standards, clear communication

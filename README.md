# Revenue Management System (RMS)

## Overview
The Revenue Management System is a browser-based application designed to calculate and manage apartment pricing at both the **floorplan** and **unit** level. The goal is to give operators transparent, math-first controls over rent pricing, renewals, and guardrails, without relying on black-box algorithms.

This project is currently a **single-page HTML/JavaScript app** with logic externalized into modular JS files. It is not yet a full-stack application but has been structured for easy migration later (e.g., into Next.js).

```

### Module Responsibilities

#### **`pricing-helpers.js`**
- Shared utility functions used across the application
- Date parsing, money formatting, percentage calculations
- Status determination, vacancy calculations
- **Public API**: `formatMoney()`, `formatPct()`, `unitStatus()`, `vacancyAgeDays()`, etc.
- **No dependencies**: Pure functions, no DOM manipulation

#### **`pricing-unit.js`**
- **Purpose**: Render unit-level pricing tables with filters and pagination
- **Inputs**: `window.mappedRows` (rent roll data), floorplan index from `buildFpIndex()`
- **Outputs**: Populated `#unitPricingSection` DOM, `window.__npUnitsFiltered` for detail overlay
- **Key Functions**:
  - `buildFpIndex()` - Creates floorplan pricing lookup
  - `buildUnitsAll()` - Retrieves all units from rent roll
  - `renderUnitPricingSection()` - Main rendering function
- **Filters**: Search, Vacant/On Notice toggles, pagination
- **Rules**:
  - Only shows Vacant and On Notice units on Unit Pricing tab
  - Groups units by floorplan code
  - Applies amenity adjustments to proposed pricing
  - Must NOT modify floorplan baseline logic

#### **`pricing-fp.js`**
- **Purpose**: Compute and render floorplan-level pricing with term premiums
- **Inputs**: `window.__fpResults` (floorplan pricing calculations), global settings
- **Outputs**: Populated `#fpPricingSection` DOM with pricing tables per floorplan
- **Key Functions**:
  - `renderNewLease()` - Renders floorplan pricing tables
  - Term premium calculations (2-14 months)
  - Seasonality and over-cap adjustments
- **Rules**:
  - Computes baseline per floorplan (referenceBase, referenceTerm)
  - Must NOT call unit rendering functions
  - Must NOT reach into unit DOM directly

#### **`app-boot.js`**
- Application initialization and tab navigation
- CSV upload and mapping logic
- Global state management
- Event listeners for main navigation

#### **`dev-guards.js`**
- Development-time boundary checks (warnings only, no behavior changes)
- Ensures separation between modules
- Example: Warns if floorplan code tries to call unit rendering

## Core Concepts

### Floorplan Pricing
- Uses **comfort target occupancy** (single-threshold target, e.g., 95%).
- Movement:
  - If trending occupancy < target → decrease rent.
  - If trending occupancy > target → increase rent.
- Base rent per floorplan is adjusted first, then:
  - **Short-term premiums** (e.g., 2-month higher rent, tapering by 1% per month).
  - **Over-cap premiums** (higher pricing for terms above reference).
  - **Seasonality adjustments** (uplift only if positive, based on month).
- **Buffer Guardrails**: Prevents decreases that would cross buffer thresholds vs. next lower tier.
- Debug information shows reference term, target/gate line, and per-term notes.

### Unit Pricing
- Mirrors floorplan pricing but shown **per unit**.
- Units inherit floorplan baseline pricing, then add:
  - **Amenity adjustments** (per-unit premiums or discounts)
  - **Status-based filtering** (Vacant, On Notice, Occupied)
  - **Availability information** (vacant days, notice date)
- **Floorplan Code Mapping**: Automatically extracts short codes from full names (e.g., "S0 - Studio" → "S0")
- Example: A vacant unit in FP S0 inherits FP base of $1,337 + $50 amenity = $1,387 proposed.

### Renewal Pricing
Renewals are generated by comparing **current rent** to **new pricing baseline**.

#### Rules:
1. If **current rent < new baseline**:
   - Apply **percent-to-new** (default 50% move toward new rent).
   - Clamp between renewal min (e.g., 0%) and max (e.g., 8% increase).
   - Apply guardrails (cap all terms).
2. If **current rent >= new baseline**:
   - Allow decreases only if toggle is ON.
   - Min/max changes allowed (defaults: −10% to −5%).
   - If toggle OFF, clamp to 0% (no decrease).

#### Example:
- Current Rent = $1,000
- New Baseline = $1,100
- Percent-to-New = 50%
- Min = 0%, Max = 8%
- Result = $1,050 (clamped between $1,000 and $1,080).

## Data Flow

```
1. CSV Upload → Column Mapping → window.mappedRows
                                        ↓
2. Run New Pricing → Floorplan Calculations → window.__fpResults
                                                      ↓
3. Floorplan Pricing Tab ← renderNewLease() ← pricing-fp.js
                                                      ↓
4. Unit Pricing Tab ← renderUnitPricingSection() ← pricing-unit.js
                                                      ↓
5. Unit Detail Overlay (future) ← buildTermsHTML() ← pricing-unit.js
```

### Key Data Structures

**`window.mappedRows`** - Array of unit objects from CSV:
```javascript
{
  unit: "A101",
  floorplan_code: "S0 - Studio",
  status: "occupied (on-notice)",
  current_rent: 1300,
  lease_end_date: "2024-12-31",
  amenity_adj: 50,
  // ... other fields
}
```

**`window.__fpResults`** - Floorplan pricing results:
```javascript
[
  {
    code: "S0",
    referenceBase: 1337,
    referenceTerm: 14,
    tiers: [/* term calculations */]
  }
]
```

---

## Settings & Configuration

### Floorplan Settings (Settings Tab)
- **Code**: Short identifier (e.g., "S0", "A1", "B2")
- **Name**: Display name (e.g., "Studio", "1x1", "2x2")
- **Units**: Total units in property (0 for new floorplans)
- **Band Low %**: Lower bound of comfort band (e.g., 93%)
- **Band High %**: Upper bound of comfort band (e.g., 96%)
- **Min Gap to Next Tier $**: Minimum price difference from next lower tier (e.g., $100)
- **Stop-Down Buffer $**: Prevents decreases below this threshold (e.g., $100)

### Floorplan Map (Settings Tab)
- Maps CSV floorplan labels to internal codes
- Example: "S0 - Studio" → "S0"
- Auto-detected on CSV upload
- Locally persisted in `localStorage` under key `rm:fpmap`

### Global Settings
- **Comfort Target Trend %**: Overall occupancy target (default 95%)
- **Pricing Adjustment Style**: Standard, Aggressive, or Custom
- **New Lease Terms (Months)**: Available lease lengths (default 2-14)

---

## If/Then Scenarios (Simplified)
- If occupancy < target → decrease base rent by step %.
- If occupancy > target → increase base rent by step %.
- If trending within comfort band → use conversion steering (based on leads/apps).
- If short-term lease (2–9 months) → apply short-term premium curve.
- If renewal below new → move % toward new rent, clamp with min/max.
- If renewal above new → allow or disallow decreases depending on toggle.
- If decrease would cross buffer threshold → block decrease (buffer guardrail).
- If floorplan gap < min gap → enforce minimum tier separation.

---

## Development Workflow
- **Cursor** = coder, **ChatGPT** = prompter/PM, **User** = visionary/operator.
- One small step at a time (Step 87, 88, 89...).
- Each change produces a new HTML file for testing (e.g., `Step 89E — architecture boundaries + docs.html`).
- All JavaScript progressively externalized into modular files with guards and docs.
- Testing done manually (upload CSV rent roll, check occupancy, confirm pricing outputs).
- **Zero Behavior Change Rule**: Each refactoring must preserve exact functionality.

### Recent Milestones
- **Step 87**: Unit term detail box + right-side toggle
- **Step 88**: Externalized CSS
- **Step 89A**: Externalized helper functions
- **Step 89B**: Externalized app boot logic
- **Step 89C**: Externalized unit pricing logic
- **Step 89D**: Externalized floorplan pricing logic
- **Step 89E**: Architecture boundaries + documentation (current)

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. ✅ Upload rent roll CSV (300 units, mixed statuses)
2. ✅ Confirm auto-detected column mapping
3. ✅ Navigate to Settings → verify floorplan settings persist
4. ✅ Navigate to Settings → confirm floorplan map
5. ✅ Click "Run New" → verify floorplan pricing tables render
6. ✅ Navigate to New Pricing → Floorplan Pricing tab

---

## Cursor's Role
- Follow prompts step by step.
- Never break working functionality.
- Externalize code in stages while preserving behavior.
- Run and verify browser tests after each change.
- Enforce boundaries between helpers, floorplan pricing, unit pricing, and app boot.
- Document all changes in code comments and architecture docs.
- Use development guards to prevent cross-module violations.

---

## Metaphor (Plain English)
Think of the app as a **spreadsheet with a brain**:
- **Floorplans** are like tabs with formulas (base rent logic).
- **Units** are rows linked to those formulas (individual apartments).
- **Renewals** are "what-if" calculations comparing last year's number to today's formula.
- **Settings** are the knobs operators can turn to steer the math safely.
- **Guards** are the rails that keep you from driving the spreadsheet off a cliff.

---

## Key Principles
- **Transparency**: Every number must be explainable with a reason chip.
- **Incremental**: Small, safe steps (new Step file for every change).
- **Operator-first**: UI shows plain English deltas, not hidden math.
- **Separation**: Floorplan vs unit vs renewals clearly divided in architecture.
- **Future-ready**: Modular enough to drop into Next.js later.
- **Zero Surprises**: No magic numbers, all calculations are traceable.
- **Local-First**: Works from filesystem, no server required (for now).

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No Persistence**: Data only stored in browser localStorage (cleared on cache clear)
2. **Single Property**: Cannot manage multiple properties simultaneously
3. **No History**: Previous pricing runs are not saved
4. **Manual CSV Upload**: Must re-upload rent roll each session
5. **No Authentication**: Anyone with file access can use the application
6. **Browser-Only**: Requires modern browser with JavaScript enabled

### Recently Fixed
- ✅ Unit pricing not rendering (floorplan code mismatch)
- ✅ Duplicate inline functions overriding externalized versions
- ✅ jQuery to vanilla JavaScript conversion
- ✅ Module boundary violations

---

## Technical Requirements

### Browser Support
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

### File System Access
- Must be served via HTTP server for proper CORS handling
- Recommended: `python3 -m http.server 8000` or similar
- Can use `file://` protocol but some features may be limited

### Data Format
CSV files must include minimum columns:
- `UnitID` or `Unit` (required)
- `Floorplan` (required)
- `Status` (required)
- `Current Rent` or `CurrentRent` (required)
- `Lease End` or `LeaseEnd` (optional but recommended)
- `AmenityAdj` (optional, defaults to 0)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Unit Pricing Not Showing
**Symptom**: Unit Pricing tab is empty after clicking  
**Cause**: Floorplan code mismatch between CSV data and settings  
**Solution**: Ensure CSV floorplan codes match settings, or use "Confirm Mapping" to auto-map

### Settings Not Saving
**Symptom**: Floorplan settings reset after refresh  
**Cause**: Browser localStorage is disabled or full  
**Solution**: Enable localStorage in browser settings, clear old data if needed

### Console Errors
**Symptom**: Red errors in browser console  
**Cause**: JavaScript loading order or missing dependencies  
**Solution**: Check that all script files load in correct order:
1. `pricing-helpers.js`
2. `pricing-unit.js`
3. `pricing-fp.js`
4. `app-boot.js`

## Contributing

### Code Style
- Use ES6+ syntax where appropriate
- Avoid jQuery (use vanilla JavaScript)
- Prefer pure functions over stateful code
- Document all public APIs in code comments
- Use meaningful variable names

### Commit Guidelines
- Each Step file represents a complete, working state
- Document all changes in Step file name
- Never delete previous Step files (they serve as history)
- Test thoroughly before committing

### Development Guards
Always check for boundary violations:
```javascript
// In pricing-unit.js
window.__RM_DEV_GUARDS?.assert(
  !window.__RM_DEV_GUARDS.hasFunction('renderNewLease'),
  'Unit code should not access floorplan rendering'
);
```
